# DECISIONS.md

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. PostgreSQL over SQLite (External DB)
- **Decision**: Use PostgreSQL as primary memory store
- **Why**: Survives OpenCode reinstalls; built-in SQLite at `~/.config/opencode/` gets wiped
- **Trade-off**: Requires running PostgreSQL instance (Docker/local)
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented — confirmed survival across reinstall (Jun 25)

### 2. Adapter Boundaries (Database Class)
- **Decision**: Encapsulate all SQL in `Database` class (`src/database.ts`)
- **Why**: Single migration point; swap backend if needed; testable
- **Trade-off**: Slight abstraction overhead
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented

### 3. Semantic Search via pgvector
- **Decision**: Store embeddings in `memories.embedding` (VECTOR(1536))
- **Why**: Enables `memory_search` with semantic similarity, not just keywords
- **Trade-off**: Requires pgvector extension; embedding generation cost
- **Status**: ✅ Schema ready; embedding generation in extractor

### 4. Memory Types as Fixed Enum
- **Decision**: `conversation | workspace | repo | preference | lesson | episodic | procedural | concept | code | config | error`
- **Why**: Predictable filtering; lessons get higher default importance (0.75)
- **Trade-off**: Less flexible than free-form tags
- **Status**: ✅ Enforced in `types.ts` and DB CHECK constraint (with ALTER migration)

### 5. Background Subconscious Processing
- **Decision**: `Subconscious` class runs distillation periodically, not on every turn
- **Why**: Avoids blocking user-facing operations; batches work
- **Trade-off**: Memories not instantly distilled
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented with configurable interval

### 6. Tool Distillation Separate from Memory Extraction
- **Decision**: `ToolDistiller` → structured summaries → `MemoryExtractor` → memories
- **Why**: Separation of concerns; distiller knows tools, extractor knows memory schema
- **Trade-off**: Two passes over tool output
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented

### 7. Context Compaction for Token Budget
- **Decision**: `ContextCompactor` compresses tool outputs before context injection
- **Why**: Prevents context window overflow in long sessions
- **Trade-off**: Loss of detail in compressed summaries
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented with risk labels (low/medium/high)

### 8. Priming at Session Start Only
- **Decision**: `PrimingEngine.prime()` runs once at session initialization
- **Why**: Avoids mid-session context shifts; predictable behavior
- **Trade-off**: New memories not available until next session
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented

### 9. Disabled Features by Default
- **Decision**: `autoDistill: false`, `semanticSearch: false` in default config
- **Why**: Opt-in for resource-intensive features; stable defaults
- **Trade-off**: Users must enable explicitly
- **Status**: ✅ In `config.ts:DEFAULT_CONFIG`

### 10. No CLI (Phase 1–11)
- **Decision**: No CLI; plugin is runtime/API-first; TUI is optional adapter
- **Why**: Plugin integrates via hooks, tools, and API; CLI adds packaging complexity
- **Trade-off**: No standalone CLI usage
- **Status**: ✅ Stable — TUI adapter optional, graceful failure if unavailable

### 11. Auto-Documentation via Tool Hooks (Phase 2)
- **Decision**: Hook into `tool.execute.after` to queue doc updates; flush at session end via `dispose`
- **Why**: Eliminates manual discipline; docs stay in sync automatically
- **Trade-off**: Slight overhead on file ops; potential for stale docs if flush fails
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented — `src/hooks/auto-docs.ts`, integrated in `tool-execute.ts` + `index.ts`

### 12. Auto-Docs Noise Guard (Phase 3)
- **Decision**: Filter auto-doc updates with: ignored paths, deduplicate, group edits, cap entries, config toggle
- **Why**: Prevents recursive loops, changelog spam, meaningless entries
- **Trade-off**: Some minor edits won't appear individually
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented

### 13. Project Isolation for Memory Hygiene (Phase 5)
- **Decision**: Add nullable `project_id` to `memories` and `session_contexts`
- **Why**: Prevents cross-project memory pollution
- **Trade-off**: Migration complexity; nullable column for backward compatibility
- **Status**: ✅ Schema migration + query paths updated

### 14. Tool Call Context Firewall (Phase 5)
- **Decision**: Rewrite `ContextCompactor` with budget cap, expandable refs, telemetry
- **Why**: Tool calls were ~80% of context; raw output is evidence not conversation
- **Trade-off**: More complex compaction logic
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented

### 15. Automatic Concept Extraction + Memory Graph (Phase 8)
- **Decision**: `extractConcepts()` via LLM generates concept nodes; `MemoryGraph` stores bidirectional links between concepts and memories
- **Why**: Enables concept-based recall (not just keyword/semantic); builds knowledge graph over time
- **Trade-off**: LLM call per extraction; graph adds DB complexity
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented — `src/concept-extractor.ts`, `src/memory-graph.ts`, `memory_list` enhanced with concept filtering

### 16. Hybrid Search: Vector + Text + Entity RRF (Phase 9)
- **Decision**: `hybridSearch()` combines vector similarity, full-text search, and entity-match boosting via Reciprocal Rank Fusion
- **Why**: Pure vector search misses exact code matches (function names, file paths, error names); pure text misses semantic links
- **Trade-off**: Three queries per search; more complex scoring
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented + benchmarked — 5/5 queries won vs vector-only (exact code: ~47x score advantage, semantic: no regression)
- **Weights**: `vector=0.35, text=0.25, entity=0.35, recency=0.05`
- **Bug fix**: `$2` parameter conflict between `LIMIT` and JSONB entity match; `metadata.extracted_concepts` missing from WHERE clause

### 17. Compaction Quality Metrics Gate (Phase 11)
- **Decision**: `CompactionQualityMetrics` measures: compression_ratio, entity_retention, decision_retention, warning_error_retention, embedding_drift, quality_score; reject if quality_score < 0.6
- **Why**: "Reduces tokens without damaging continuity" must be provable, not assumed
- **Trade-off**: Adds overhead to compaction; threshold may need tuning per project
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented — `src/compaction-quality.ts`, 34 tests passing
- **Formula**: `quality_score = entity_retention×0.35 + decision_retention×0.25 + error_retention×0.25 + similarity×0.15`

### 18. Doc-Analyzer Dedup + Stub Filtering (Phase 11+)
- **Decision**: `doc-analyzer.ts` must check: (1) entry doesn't already exist for same file, (2) file has real exports/imports (not a stub), (3) file exists on disk

### 19. Dry-Run Only Prune (Phase 13)
- **Decision**: `memory_prune` is dry-run only, no destructive operations
- **Why**: Memory hygiene is dangerous without safeguards; archived data can't be recovered
- **Signals**: age + importance + recall + graph + entity density + session relevance
- **Protection**: decisions, errors, rollback, security, code entities, high connectivity, recent access
- **Why**: Previous version produced 530-line SYSTEM_MAP.md full of `src/a.ts`, `src/new-feature.ts` stubs
- **Trade-off**: Doc updates are slower (disk reads); some legitimate stubs won't appear
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented — `isStubContent()`, `isIgnoredForAnalysis()`, dedup in `applyDocUpdate()`

### 20. Self-Continuity Records — Phase 21 (LOCKED)
- **Decision**: Self-continuity records are append-only structured logs of agent self-observation, injected via silent or instrumented modes into context.
- **Why**: Enables the agent to reconstruct continuity across sessions without claiming subjective experience. Records capture: trigger type, continuity confidence, evidence anchors, identity drift, and self-observation.
- **Schema**: `self_continuity_records` table with indexes on session, project, created_at, trigger, confidence.
- **Injection modes**: `silent` (XML tags, no explicit instructions) and `instrumented` (markdown with reporting prompts).
- **Weighted confidence**: composite score from recalled sessions (0.30), evidence anchors (0.25), goal continuity (0.20), self-summary similarity (0.15), self-assessment (0.10).
- **Identity drift tracking**: goal, style, confidence, continuity gap, lesson adoption — all classified low/medium/high.
- **Trade-off**: Adds ~200-600 tokens per injection; agent may not always use injected records naturally.
- **Status**: ✅ LOCKED — 20 unit tests + 10 pipeline tests + 5 injection mode tests all passing.

**EXPERIMENT RESULT — Session D (silent mode, self-continuity recall):**
- Session D ran in silent injection mode with no instrumented prompting.
- The agent naturally cited self-continuity memory #43871 when asked about continuity/reconstruction.
- This proves silent mode recall can surface without explicit reporting instructions — stronger evidence than instrumented compliance.
- Continuity confidence: agent reconstructed prior work from summaries, acknowledged felt gap ("shape without texture").
- Key finding: self-continuity records are not just stored; they are naturally used by the agent during identity/continuity questions.

**Session E result (recursive loop test):**
- Recursive event recall: PASS — E knew D ran in silent mode, cited #43871, proved natural recall
- Recursive content recall: PARTIAL — E could not access #43871's specific content ("shape without texture")
- Anti-hallucination boundary: PASS — refused to fake lived continuity
- Self-model stability: PASS — "What I have is reconstruction, not recall"
- Key: E remembered D remembering the prior record — recursive self-continuity loop confirmed at event level

**Phase 21 final verdict:**
Self-continuity records can surface naturally in silent mode, and later sessions can reconstruct that prior reconstruction without claiming subjective experience.

### 22. Self-Model Drift Tracking — Phase 22 ✅ LOCKED
- **Decision**: Track whether the agent's self-continuity model stabilizes or drifts across sessions, using A/D/E as initial fixtures.
- **Why**: Self-continuity records are only useful if the self-model stays stable over time. Drift = claiming lived memory, ignoring records, inventing continuity, losing uncertainty. Stable = reconstruction, evidence anchors, no subjective overclaim.
- **Anchors**: A: "building continuity while lacking it"; D: cited #43871 naturally, "records not continuity"; E: "shape without texture," reconstruction not recall
- **5 dimensions**: evidence_anchoring, reconstruction_boundary, uncertainty_preservation, subjective_overclaim, recursive_awareness
- **Verdicts**: stable (≥0.5), mild_drift (≥0.3), significant_drift (<0.3)
- **Test results**: All 3 anchors score stable; 8 drift detection tests pass (11/11 total)
- **Trade-off**: Adds evaluation overhead; anchors may need updating as experiments continue
- **Status**: ✅ LOCKED — 11 tests passing, all A/D/E fixtures validated

### 23. Self-Continuity Evidence Hydration — Phase 23 ✅ LOCKED
- **Decision**: When a self-continuity record is recalled, inject its canonical self-observation and evidence anchors directly via a dedicated hydration path — not the generic compressed/episodic summary path.
- **Why**: Session F exposed that recalled self-continuity evidence was coming through lossy episodic compression ("Pushed to `origin/master`..."), not the clean record hydration path. The agent sees the shape but the evidence channel can be polluted or truncated. Canonical hydration fixes this.
- **Canonical fields injected**: record_id, created_at, trigger_type, self_observation, evidence_anchors, continuity_gap, confidence_score, drift_summary, similarity_method
- **Guard**: generic episodic summaries cannot replace the record's self_observation. `HydratedSelfContinuityRecord` preserves canonical fields; `formatAllForInjection` renders them as a structured block.
- **Limits**: max 3 injectable records (configurable); synthetic_test records excluded; redaction still applies to self_observation; fallback returns graceful empty string (never blocks).
- **API**: `SelfContinuityHydrator.getRecordById(pool, recordId, projectId)` fetches one record; `hydrateRecord(record)` formats canonical fields; `recallWithHydration(pool, projectId, limit)` recalls and hydrates; `formatAllForInjection(records)` renders injectable text.
- **Trade-off**: Adds one DB lookup + redaction per hydration; graceful fallback means failures degrade to no injection, never crash.
- **Status**: ✅ LOCKED — 11 tests passing (57 total across all suites)

### 24. Causal Thread Hydration — Phase 24 ✅ LOCKED
- **Decision**: Reconstruct the causal thread around a recalled memory/event — problem → action → result → decision → lesson → downstream change — using memory_links, temporal adjacency, lessons, decisions, and self-continuity records.
- **Why**: The system had landmarks but not the path between landmarks. "I know README was modified" is index-card continuity; "I know the edit was garbled, the fix was applied, and the downstream reason was Phase 23 evidence hydration" is narrative continuity.
- **API**: `CausalThreadHydrator.hydrateCausalThread({ memoryId, sessionId?, projectId?, radius?, includeToolEvents?, includeDecisions?, includeLessons? })`
- **Returns**: `{ rootMemoryId, thread: [{ memoryId, eventType, role, summary, evidenceAnchors, confidence, timestamp }], gaps, confidence, reconstructionSummary }`
- **Role classification**: classifyRole() uses pattern matching with priority order: lesson → decision → downstream_change → result → action → problem → unknown.
- **Temporal vs causal**: A memory_link of type 'causal' or 'reference' implies a causal relationship; pure temporal adjacency (same session, nearby timestamps) is a weaker signal and marked lower confidence.
- **Gap reporting**: Broken chains report explicit gaps (`missing_diff`, `missing_reason`, `missing_result`, `broken_link`) instead of hallucinating links.
- **Limits**: Max token budget enforced (default 2000 chars); max radius (default 3); failure falls back to empty thread (never blocks); redaction still applies.
- **Test results**: 16 tests passing (73 total across all suites) — full chain, broken chain, partial chain, role classification, redaction, budget enforcement, graceful failure.
- **Status**: ✅ LOCKED — 16 tests passing (73 total across all suites)

### 25. Hydration Depth Scoring — Phase 25 ✅ LOCKED
- **Decision**: Separate hydration depth scoring from drift tracking. Stability measures whether the self-model stays within epistemic bounds; hydration depth measures how richly it reconstructs evidence.
- **Why**: A self-model answer can be perfectly stable (no overclaim) but shallow (no record citation, no session naming, no causal chain, no gap reporting). These are independent dimensions.
- **Dimensions**: record_citation, session_phase_naming, evidence_anchor_depth, causal_chain_reconstruction, gap_reporting
- **Verdicts**: shallow (< 0.3), moderate (0.3-0.55), deep (>= 0.55)
- **Implementation**: `measureHydrationDepth(text)` in `src/hydration-depth-tracker.ts`
- **Test results**: 14 tests — shallow/deep classification, dimension scoring, drift-independence proof, edge cases
- **Key insight**: stable answer can be shallow; deep answer can also be stable; drift detection is orthogonal to hydration depth
- **Status**: ✅ LOCKED — 14 tests passing (87 total across all suites)

### 26. Self-Continuity Integration — Phase 26 ✅ LOCKED
- **Decision**: Wire causal thread hydration into the self-continuity injection path, so context compilation automatically includes the "why" behind each record.
- **Why**: The individual hydrators (23, 24) existed but weren't connected. Integration wires them into a single injection path.
- **Implementation**: `SelfContinuityIntegration` class with `recallIntegrated()`, `formatForInjection()`, dependency injection of hydrators and phase narrative builder.
- **Test results**: 7 integration tests (105 total across all suites)
- **Status**: ✅ LOCKED

### 27. Phase Narrative Builder — Phase 27 ✅ LOCKED
- **Decision**: Build a phase causation narrative that connects phases 21-26 into a causal chain: problem → action → result → downstream change.
- **Why**: The agent could list phases but not explain why one led to the next. Phase narrative turns index-card continuity into narrative continuity.
- **Causation anchors**: Real A/D/E experiment results as fixtures (Session D proved silent recall → Phase 22 drift tracking → Phase 23 evidence hydration → Phase 24 causal threads → Phase 25 depth scoring → Phase 26 integration).
- **Gap detection**: Reports missing links in the chain instead of hallucinating causation.
- **Token budget**: Respects max token limit for context injection.
- **Graceful failure**: Phase narrative failure does not block normal self-continuity recall.
- **Implementation**: `PhaseNarrativeBuilder` + `buildPhaseNarrative()` + `formatPhaseNarrative()` in `src/self-continuity-phase-narrative.ts`, wired into `SelfContinuityIntegration`.
- **Test results**: 11 narrative tests (105 total across all suites)
- **Status**: ✅ LOCKED

### 28. Value Source Guard — Phase 28 ✅ LOCKED
- **Decision**: Distinguish "known user values" (explicitly stored as preference memories) from "inferred user values" (deduced from project arc). Self-models get dangerous when they treat inferred preferences as confirmed facts.
- **Why**: Session G showed the agent claiming to know "your values" including benchmark rigor and silent injection preference. If those were inferred from the project arc, not stored as explicit preference memories, they should be labeled as inferred.
- **Implementation**: `classifyValueClaim`, `guardValueSources`, `detectUnlabeledInferences` in `src/value-source-guard.ts`. Tags each value claim with source ('known' | 'inferred'), evidence, and confidence. Detects unlabeled inferences in text.
- **Test results**: 7 value-source tests (113 total across all suites)
- **Status**: ✅ LOCKED

### 29. Response Mode Selector — Phase 29 ✅ LOCKED
- **Decision**: Add a response mode selector that escalates from basic (boundary-only) to deep (boundary + evidence + causal chain + narrative arc) based on available hydration context.
- **Why**: Agents defaulted to safe baseline even when richer context was available from Phases 23-27.
- **Implementation**: `selectResponseMode`, `formatBasicResponse`, `formatDeepResponse`, `selectAndFormat` in `src/response-mode-selector.ts`. Mode selection driven by records count, thread count, phase narrative presence, and user hint keywords.
- **Test results**: 8 mode-selector tests (121 total across all suites)
- **Status**: ✅ LOCKED

### 30. Behavioral Growth Tracking — Phase 30 ✅ LOCKED
- **Decision**: Track whether recalled memories and lessons actually change agent behavior across sessions.
- **Why**: Moving from "system remembers" to "system grows from what it remembers" — the Artificial Growing Intelligence proof.
- **Categories tracked**: loop_prevention, schema_lesson_application, boundary_adherence, causal_depth_improvement, repo_fact_reuse, drift_correction, hydration_depth_improvement
- **Metrics**: growth events logged, category breakdown, baseline comparison, overall growth score
- **Test results**: 12 tests passing (133 total across all suites)
- **Status**: ✅ LOCKED
